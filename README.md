# Reference-Project-in-PHP


This is simple student's Reference(Academic) Project in Core PHP guided by me. 
This website is on "Backery Shop" which is fully dynamic. 
In this website, 'AddToCart' Module is not done, means without 'AddToCart' module.
This website contains- 
  1. Admin Module- 
           In this module,
              * Login Phase     - (Login with Credential, display username in index file, Logout)
              * Category Phase  - (Add,Display,Edit,Delete functionality)
              * Product Phase   - (Add,Display,Edit,Delete functionality)
              * FeedBack Phase  - (Display, Delete functionality)
  2. Client Module-
           In this module,
              * Category display
              * Specific Category wise Product display
              * Whatever product we want to select, than the detail of selected product detail page will be opened.
              
  
  Second .rar file i.e 'project', which contains same all above functionality but teached one by one functionality (live demo) in project lab.
